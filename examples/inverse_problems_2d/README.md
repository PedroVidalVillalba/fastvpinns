# Inverse problems 2D with FastVPINNs
---
This section contains examples of solving inverse problems in 2D using the `fastvpinns` package. The examples are organized as follows:

- [Inverse Problems with Constant Coefficients](./const_inverse_poisson2d/): Examples of solving inverse problems in 2D with constant coefficients.
- [Inverse Problems with Spatially Varying Coefficients](./spatial_inverse_poisson2d/): Examples of solving inverse problems in 2D with spatially varying coefficients.
