# Solving Inverse Problems with FastVPINNs : Estimation of spatially varying parameter on a complex geometry.

In this example, we will learn how to solve inverse problems on a complex geometry using FastVPINNs. In particular, we will solve the 2-dimensional convection-diffusion equation while simultaneously estimating the spatially dependent diffusion parameter using synthetic sensor data.
