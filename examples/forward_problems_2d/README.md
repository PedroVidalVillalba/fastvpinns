# Examples of Solving Forward Problems in 2D

This section contains examples of solving forward problems in 2D using the `fastvpinns` package. The examples are organized as follows:

- [Complex Mesh](./complex_mesh)
- [uniform_mesh](./uniform_mesh)
- [hard_boundary_constraints](./hard_boundary_constraints)

## Complex Mesh
---

This section holds the example on how we can solve a forward problem using convection-diffusion equation in 2D using a complex mesh. 

## Uniform Grid
---

This section holds the example on how we can solve a forward problem using convection-diffusion equation in 2D using a uniform mesh.
- [Poisson2D](./uniform_mesh/poisson_2d)
- [Helmholtz2D](./uniform_mesh/helmholtz_2d)

## hard_boundary_constraints
---

This section deals with the example on how we can solve a forward problem using Poisson equation in 2D using hard boundary constraints.
